title: Another Year, Another Static Site Generator

This year's hotness: [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). Being the web hipster that I am,
of course I switched. Not that I didn't have a good reason, I had already
written two or three posts with Middleman, so it felt really old and used.

On a serious note, Middleman does feel a bit limiting when you build more
complex sites with it. But maybe using static site generators for anything other
than simple blogs and documentation is just a bad idea. It's certainly a lot
better than Jekyll and its awful Liquid templating syntax.
