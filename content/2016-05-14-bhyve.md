title: Getting started with bhyve

I've been running a home server for a few years, but my upload is just too poor to
do anything serious with it, so I got myself a cheap dedicated server. Installed
FreeBSD, because lets try bhyve, their new-ish hypervisor.

The default "frontend" to bhyve is quite complex, so I used [vm-bhyve](https://github.com/churchers/vm-bhyve)
instead, which can definitely compete with Docker in ease of use.

So let's install it. It is in ports, but the package usually outdated, so
make sure you install from source.

```
# if you don't have the ports tree yet
portsnap fetch extract
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/vm-bhyve && make install clean
```

Some initial config:

```
mkdir /var/vm
zfs create -o mountpoint=/var/vm zroot/vm
echo 'pf_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
echo 'vm_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
echo 'vm_dir="zfs:zroot/vm"' >> /etc/rc.conf
vm init
cp /usr/local/share/examples/vm-bhyve/* /var/vm/.templates/
```

This is enough to be able to launch VMs, but we want networking as well.

```
echo 'net.inet.ip.forwarding=1' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
vm switch create public
vm switch add public em0
vm switch nat public on
pkg install dnsmasq
echo 'dnsmasq_enable="YES"' >> /etc/rc.conf
mv /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf.bhyve /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf
service dnsmasq start
```

vm-bhyve will add a include line to `/etc/pf.conf`, you might
have to move it up a bit (check with `pfctl -f /etc/pf.conf`).

Now, we need an ISO, which vm-bhyve can download for us:

```
vm iso ftp://ftp.freebsd.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/amd64/amd64/ISO-IMAGES/10.3/FreeBSD-10.3-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso
```

If you want to download iso manually, just put them in `/var/vm/.iso/`.
Let's launch a VM:

```
vm create -t freebsd-zpool -s 50G freebsd1
vm install freebsd1 FreeBSD-10.3-RELEASE-amd64-disc1.iso
vm console freebsd1
```

Now, just go through the installer as usual. Easy!

Next step: figure out how to assign IPv6 addresses to VMs.
Hopefully not too hard.
