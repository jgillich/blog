Have you read about Nix, skimmed the [home page](http://nixos.org/) and found
no compelling reason to use it? Here is a list of some common tools, listing
the same problems Nix and NixOS solve, and the one's they don't.

## NixOS vs Docker

NixOS does:

* Run everywhere: Docker images run on any Linux distribution, so do Nix
  packages. Both install their own copy of dependencies to make this possible,
  with significant disk space overhead. Nix also supports BSD and Mac, although
  these are second-class citizens.

* Deterministic outputs: Like Dockerfiles, Nix packages are
  deterministic, meaning they will always produce the same output. Docker
  does this mostly by caching image layers, Nix will actually enforce this
  using hashes.


NixOS doesn't:

* Process isolation: NixOS runs services as regular processes alongside each other
  (although it does support sysyemd-nspawn containers, Docker is arguably more
  secure).
